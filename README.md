    Memex is a sophisticated decentralized application (dApp) designed for creating, hosting and managing meme token launches on a bonding curve. A bonding curve allows for token trading even before the token reaches marketcap. Built for EVM-compatible chains, Memex leverages the automated market making (AMM) constant product algorithm and a secure prebonding mechanism to create a reliable and profitable platform for administrators, meme creators, and meme traders.

## Demo Access

To fully test the demo, ensure you have a working web3 wallet. Any connected address can access admin.

## Smart Contract Architecture

### Factory Pattern Implementation

The system employs a factory pattern for contract deployment, offering:

1. **Gas Efficiency**: Utilizes clone proxies to reduce deployment costs by up to 60%
2. **Centralized Management**: Factory serves as a hub for all contract deployments
3. **Standardization**: Ensures consistency across all deployed contracts
4. **Cost Control**: Optimizes gas consumption for contract deployment

### Deployment Costs

Gas costs vary by network:

-   Layer 1 networks (e.g., Ethereum): $8-12 USD
-   Layer 2 networks (e.g., Base): $4-6 USD
